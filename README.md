This software allows the user to enter up to 4 digit operands (integers only, no floating point numbers), and can apply 4 different operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division (floating point answers (3 numbers after the decimal) will be printed on LCD) e.g 4.432


The 4th column in the 4x4 KEYPAD is the column responsible for the operations (*, /, +, -).
The lower left button is the equal (=) button.
The button in the 2nd Column in the last row is the number '0'.
The button in the 3rd Column in the last row clears the Display and resets the calculator.
